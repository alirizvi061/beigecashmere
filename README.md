## Introduction 
BEIGE CASHEMRE - YOUR DESTINATION FOR ALL YOUR VIDEO PRODUCTION & PHOTOGRAPHY NEEDS

## Approach
The approach taken for this specific project was detailed driven. This web experience was curated to the requirements of the client because it will be used by hundreds of users daily. First meeting with the client was set to understand how the website would execute the needs of the business. After the initial requirments were noted, a plan of action was created and potential technologies were taken into consideration for this project. Then the workload was broken down and delegated based on team member expertise. 

After the initial build, the website was sent to the client for review with user testing documentation. After that the client's feedback was received and the necessary adjustments were made before deployment.

## Technologies Used

## Forward Thoughts
